*This poem was written with the assistance of chat gpt*
In a quaint New Zealand town, Sasha made her way,
With parents working from home, in the IT's sway.
Her sister, her comrade, in the countryside they'd play,
Learning from Mum online, in their homeschool array.

While Sasha's friends attended school, she joined scouts with glee,
In the bush they'd roam, building forts, wild and free.
Their laughter echoed through the trees, as happy as can be,
In nature's embrace, their spirits soared, you see.

Through seasons they ventured, in this rural retreat,
In simplicity's rhythm, their lives found a beat.
With shared adventures, memories sweet,
In Sasha's New Zealand town, joy was complete.
